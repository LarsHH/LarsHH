                <h3>Sherpa: Hyperparameter Optimization for Machine Learning Models</h3>

                <p>Sherpa is a hyperparameter optimization library for machine learning models.
                It is specifically designed for problems with computationally expensive, iterative function evaluations, such as the hyperparameter tuning of deep neural
                networks. With Sherpa, scientists can quickly optimize hyperparameters using a variety of powerful and interchangeable algorithms. Sherpa can be run
                on either a single machine or in parallel on a cluster. Finally, an interactive
                dashboard enables users to view the progress of models as they are trained,
                cancel trials, and explore which hyperparameter combinations are working
                best. Sherpa empowers machine learning practitioners by automating the
                more tedious aspects of model tuning.</p>

                <h3>Improved Energy Reconstruction in NOvA with Regression Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>In neutrino experiments, neutrino energy reconstruction is crucial because neutrino oscillations
                and differential cross-sections are functions of neutrino energy. It is also challenging due to the
                complexity in the detector response and kinematics of final state particles. We propose a regression
                Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method to reconstruct electron neutrino energy and
                electron energy in the NOvA neutrino experiment. We demonstrate that with raw detector pixel
                inputs, a regression CNN can reconstruct event energy even with complicated final states involving
                lepton and hadrons. Compared with kinematics-based energy reconstruction, this method achieves
                a significantly better energy resolution. The reconstructed to true energy ratio shows comparable
                or less dependence on true energy, hadronic energy fractions, and interaction modes. The regression
                CNN also shows smaller systematic uncertainties from the simulation of neutrino interactions. The
                proposed energy estimator provides improvements of 16% and 12% in RMS for νe CC and electron,
                respectively. This method can also be extended to solve other regression problems in HEP, taking
                over kinematics-based reconstruction tasks.</p>
